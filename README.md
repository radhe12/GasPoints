# GasPoints

This is basic example of Room percistence library in kotlin

In this you can select Brand of your gas points card and add qr code information (code text).
It will generate Card with QR code which you can scan at store.

You can Add, View , Delete and Update your card from this Application.

Here Insert, Delete and update queries perfomed in background thread using AsyncTask and View operation perfomed using LiveData.

I have plan to add UI and Unit Testing to this repository so stay tune.

Happy Coding!
